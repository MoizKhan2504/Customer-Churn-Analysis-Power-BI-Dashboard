# Customer Churn Analysis | Power-BI Dashboard

# Project Description

This project is a Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard built in Power BI to help telecom businesses understand and reduce customer attrition. Using a single CSV dataset, the data was loaded and cleaned in Power Query, calculated columns were created for analysis, and DAX measures were developed to calculate churn KPIs and trends.

The final deliverable is an interactive, dynamic Power BI dashboard that allows business users to explore churn reasons, customer demographics, and payment/contract details to identify key factors driving churn.

# Aim & Objectives

To analyze customer churn reasons and their impact.

To explore churn by contract type, payment method, and data plan usage.

To identify churn trends by age, gender, location, and monthly charges.

To create an interactive dashboard for management to track churn and take action.
